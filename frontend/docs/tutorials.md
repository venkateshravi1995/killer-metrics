## Build your first dashboard
1. Install dependencies and start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Open the app in your browser (typically `http://localhost:3000`).
3. Add a tile, pick a visualization, and select at least one metric.
4. Configure the tile’s data range and (optionally) filters.
5. Save your dashboard.

## Configure a KPI tile
1. Add a new tile and choose **KPI** as the visualization.
2. Choose a single metric.
3. Optionally enable “comparison” to show the sparkline preview.
4. Set the delta display mode (percent/value/both).
